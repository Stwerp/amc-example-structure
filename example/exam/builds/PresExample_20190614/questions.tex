\copygroup[2]{unita}{questions}
\copygroup{unitb}{questions}
}

% The order is defined in the processexams.tex file.
% For this project, each instance of an exam will:
%   1) clear the "questions" group
%   2) call the command "FormTestQuestions"
%   3) insert the group "questions"
%   4) clear a double page (to enable double-sided printing)
%
% So you need to create a command called "FormTestQuestions" that will
% copy over whatever want into the "questions" group.
% In THIS FILE's case, I am selecting 2 (out of the three I have defined) questions
%  from the "unita" group, and all questions from the "unitb" group. The order of
%  the questions on the output will be completely intermixed.

% The other option is to change the process exams to to call the command "FormTestQuestions" and then "InsertTestQuestions". This will allow you to do things like "\insertgroup{unita} \insertgroup{unitb}" where questions from unita will appear before questions from unitb and not be intermixed.
